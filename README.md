# 🧠 Python Data Engineering Portfolio

This repository contains **fully local and free-to-run examples** of Python code for practicing **Data Engineering** concepts.  
All examples can be executed on your own computer — no paid services or cloud setup required.

## 🚀 What You'll Find

### 🧩 Core Topics
- **ETL Pipelines**: End-to-end examples of data extraction, transformation, and loading.  
- **PySpark & Pandas**: Data processing and transformation at scale (PySpark examples can run locally).  
- **SQL & CSV**: Database integration using local CSVs and SQLite.  
- **API Ingestion**: Scripts to fetch and process data from public APIs.  
- **Best Practices**: Clean code, modular design, and clear documentation.

## 📚 Example Ideas

### 🔹 ETL and Data Processing
- Build an **ETL pipeline** that extracts data from CSV, transforms it with Pandas or PySpark, and outputs a transformed CSV.  
- Demonstrate **data cleaning, filtering, and aggregation** using Pandas.  
- Use **PySpark in local mode** to process larger datasets with transformations and joins.

### 🔹 Database and Local Storage
- Work with **CSV files** and **SQLite** for local database simulation.  
- Save processed data in multiple formats like CSV and Parquet.  

### 🔹 Automation and Orchestration
- Modular **Python scripts** for ETL tasks.  
- Optional: create a small **Airflow DAG locally** (requires local Airflow installation).
