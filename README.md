## 01_basics - Basic Python

Learn and find examples of:

- Data types (`int`, `float`, `str`, `bool`) and variables
- Operators (arithmetic, logical, comparison, bitwise)
- Control structures (`if`, `for`, `while`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`)
- Collections (`list`, `tuple`, `set`, `dict`) and comprehensions
- Functions and parameter handling (`*args`, `**kwargs`)
- Basic error handling (`try`, `except`, `finally`)
- Input and output (`input()`, reading/writing files)

---

## 02_intermediate - Intermediate Python

Deepen your knowledge with:

- Modules and packages
- Object-Oriented Programming (classes, inheritance, special methods)
- Advanced functions (lambda, decorators, closures)
- Advanced file handling (CSV, JSON)
- Virtual environments and dependency management
- Basic testing with `unittest`
- Useful standard libraries (`datetime`, `collections`, `itertools`, `math`, `random`)

---

## 03_advanced - Advanced Python

For developers aiming to master Python:

- Advanced exceptions and context managers
- Advanced decorators and metaprogramming
- Functional programming (`map`, `filter`, `reduce`)
- Iterators and generators (`yield`, `next`)
- Concurrency: `threading`, `multiprocessing`, `asyncio`
- Professional dependency management (`pip`, `poetry`, `pipenv`)

---

## 04_data - Python for Data & Automation

Examples and exercises focused on data engineering and automation:

- Pandas: Series, DataFrames, joins, cleaning and manipulation
- NumPy: arrays and vectorized operations
- ETL: reading, transforming, and loading data
- APIs: fetching external data with `requests`
- Task automation (`schedule`, cron jobs)
- Database connections: SQLite and SQLAlchemy

---

## 05_projects - Mini Projects

Practical projects combining learned skills:

1. Currency converter using an API
2. ETL that cleans a dataset and generates metrics
3. Simple web scraper using `BeautifulSoup`
4. File automation script
5. Server log analysis
6. Simple dashboard with `streamlit`
7. Text processing (word frequency analysis)

---

## Best Practices and Style

- Type hinting with `typing`
- Documentation using docstrings and `pydoc`
- Code formatting and linting (`black`, `flake8`)
- SOLID principles and PEP8
- Git and GitHub usage (clear and organized commits)
